## Draw Me A Comment

What if instead of _writing_ a comment on a WordPress blog post... you could _draw_ one?

This codebase contains the requisite PHP and JS code to add this capability, on a post-by-post basis, to the "Q23" theme used on [DanQ.me](https://danq.me/).
The theme itself is closed-source (and without a doubt too tied-in to Dan's very-specific requirements to be of use to others anyway), but there's probably
sufficient code in this repository that an ambitious soul could adapt it for use on their own WordPress site. Or even to convert it into a general-purpose
WordPress plugin.

In the meantime: to see it at work, visit [DanQ.me/draw-me-a-comment](https://danq.me/draw-me-a-comment)
